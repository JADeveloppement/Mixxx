<h3>Custom Mixxx Settings</h3>

There are my custom Mixxx Settings to use the Pioneer DDJ-200 with extended control that allows minimal (or no) use of the mouse when all the hardware is set up.
By default, the <a href="https://github.com/dan-giddins/mixxx-ddj-200-mapping" target="_blank">DJ controller settings</a> provided by Dan Giddins can be enough to use every functions of the controller, but it lacked some crucial functions in order to mix properly. Here are the settings I changed with my configuration : 

<li><b><u>Deck 1 :</u></b></li>
<b>Pad 5 :</b> Loop In<br>
<b>Pad 6 :</b> Loop Out<br>
<b>Pad 7 :</b> Reloop Toogle<br>
<b>Pad 8 :</b> Non Assigned<br>
<br>
<li><b><u>Deck 2 :</u></b></li>
<b>Pad 5 :</b> Loop In<br>
<b>Pad 6 :</b> Loop Out<br>
<b>Pad 7 :</b> Reloop Toogle<br>
<b>Pad 8 :</b> Non Assigned<br>
<br>
<br>
Even with that, Pioneer didn't give enough buttons/pad with the DDJ-200 to let us use the FX decks, so, using the application (paid) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.volcanomobile.midi_controller&hl=fr&gl=US&pli=1" target="_blank">Midi Controller</a> on the Play Store, I added more functions. You can link your DDJ-200 and your android phone in MIDI mode to use them both in order to have a more complete control of Mixxx software that is really complete and useful for an amateur use, and easy to use with a minimal setup :

<br>When starting Mixxx, the left pane is focused by default, and we have to click on the right pane to select the next song with the Pioneer. In this tab, you can focus directly on the right pane (with your tracks) without using the mouse.
